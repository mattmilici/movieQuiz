# Movie Buff

The Movie Quiz can be found here: [https://mmilici-star.github.io/movieQuiz/dist/index.html](https://mmilici-star.github.io/movieQuiz/dist/index.html)

## Introduction

We developed this application as a cool way to utilize the movie database API to create an application that would quiz the user on guessing actors and movies.

We used the Tailwind CSS framework, The Movie Database API, Giphy API, and JQuery UI to build, style, and add effects to our application.

## User Story

AS an avid movie watcher.

I WANT to play a game that will allow me to guess an actor that has been in a movie.

So THAT I can gauge my score compared to my friends and gain bragging rights.

## Usage

When the user first enters this page this is what they will see.

![Buff Main Page; Let's test your movie knowledge!](https://github.com/mmilici-star/movieQuiz/blob/master/Assets/Main_Page.PNG)

To learn how to play the game, the user can click on "How to Play!" for a quick tutorial. There will be a series of prompts that will teach the user how to play the game.

![How to play page.](https://github.com/mmilici-star/movieQuiz/blob/master/Assets/How_to.PNG)

At the end of the tutorial, the user can click on "Start Playing!" where they will be given a choice between naming movies or actors.

If the user clicks on the "Movies" button, they will be given a prompt to enter any movie.

![Enter any movie to get started!](https://github.com/mmilici-star/movieQuiz/blob/master/Assets/Movies.PNG)

The user is then given a random actor in the previously entered movie. The user will then have to enter a different movie that the actor has been in.

![Enter a movie with this Actor: Robert Downey Jr.](https://github.com/mmilici-star/movieQuiz/blob/master/Assets/Movies1.PNG)

If the user is correct, they will be given another actor or actress from the previously inputted movie. If the user is incorrect, they will lose a life. If the user loses 3 lives, the game is over.

If the user clicks on the "Actors" button, they will be given a prompt to enter an actor or actress to get started.

![Enter an actor or actress!](https://github.com/mmilici-star/movieQuiz/blob/master/Assets/Actors.PNG)

The user is then given a random movie that the previously entered actor has been in. The user will then have to input a different actor that has been in that movie.

![Enter an actor that is in this Movie: "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"](https://github.com/mmilici-star/movieQuiz/blob/master/Assets/Actors2.PNG)

If the user is correct, they will be given another movie that the previously entered actor has been in. If the user inputs an actor that was not in the movie or guesses the same actor, they will lose a life. The user can also submit a blank answer to get a new movie that the previously entered actor has been in.

The game ends when the user loses their 3 lives or if the application cannot give the user a new movie.
